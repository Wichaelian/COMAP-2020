# ICM-2021
Hello and welcome to our submission for COMAP's 2021 MCM/ICM Problem D: The Influence of Music.

This year we were challenged to find solutions for several tasks requiring cleaning, manipulation and analysis of the provided song, artist and influence data. The main goal, supplemented by numerous explorations into edge cases, was to model the influence of music over time and evaluate the impact individual artists have made within and between genres, as well as music overall.

Here is a directory to point you towards our specific notebooks the contain the code you might be looking for:
