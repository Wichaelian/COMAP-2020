# ICM-2021
Hello and welcome to our submission for COMAP's 2021 MCM/ICM Problem D: The Influence of Music.

This year we were challenged to find solutions for several tasks requiring cleaning, manipulation and analysis of the provided song, artist and influence data. The main goal, supplemented by numerous explorations into edge cases, was to model the influence of music over time and evaluate the impact individual artists have made within and between genres, as well as music overall.

Please feel free to explore our models and visuals in the juypyter notebooks.

Here is a directory to point you towards the notebooks that correspond with the sections in our submission manuscript:

  Bullet 1.ipynb <--> Directed Graph of Musial Influence
  Bullet 2.ipynb <--> Measuring Music Similarity
  Bullet 3.ipynb <--> Relational Genres 
  Bullet 4.ipynb <--> Correlation of Causation
  Bullet 5.ipynb <--> Revolutionary Records
  Bullet 6.ipynb <--> Dynamical Influences
  Bullet 7.ipynb <--> Cultural Reflections of Music

Thank you for checking out the code that guided our project!
